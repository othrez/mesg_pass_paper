\section{Experimental Results}

\Cref{tbl:experiments} displays the results of running \MPass\ tool on  some examples;
whereas \Cref{tbl:experiments_f} shows the results of running \MPass\ on some protocols which were intentionally modified in order to introduce some errors.
%
The displayed  examples are taken from \cite{JRSVgit}  which are further described in \cite{MPSV11} and \cite{RSV11}.
%
Bounded Retransmission Protocol (\Brp) is also adapted from \cite{AABJ04}.


Columns of both tables should be interpreted as follows:
%
\begin{inparaenum}
\item {\bf P} lists the name of the protocol under analysis.
\item {\bf Bad} indicates both the process and the state of the process for which the state reachability analysis is conducted.
\item {\bf Sem} indicated the channel semantic used for the analysis: \textit{lossy} (\Lcs), \textit{stuttering} (\Slcs) or \textit{unordered} (\Ucs).
%\item {\bf channel} describes how channels are formed.  More precisely, we provide three different ways for defining the channels:
%\begin{inparaenum}
%\item {\bf xml:}  Channels are specified in the \xml file of the protocol.
%\item {\bf prefix:} Channels are constructed based on the first alphabet of the messages.
%\item {\bf process:} There is exactly one channel per process.
%\end{inparaenum}
%We used the \textbf{process} kind of channel specification.
\item Constraint generation (\textbf{Const. gen.}),
\item \textbf{\Smt\ check} and
\item {\bf Total time} lists, respectively, the time taken by \MPass\ to generate  the \Smt-formula,
the time taken by the \Smt\ solver \texttt{z3} to check the satisfiability of that formula and the total time of the analysis
(time is given in seconds).
\item {\bf Assert. Nb.} lists the number of assertions fed to the \Smt\ solver.
\item {\bf Ph.} indicates the bound on the number of phases. Finally,
\item {\bf Res} gives the result of the analysis. The result is either \textbf{Unsafe} if the bad state is reachable (i.e. the \Smt\ formula is satisfiable), or
\textbf{Safe}  if the bad state is not reachable under the bounded-phase assumption and for the considered channel semantic
(i.e. the \Smt\ formula is unsatisfiable).
\end{inparaenum}

Results displayed here are for few protocols only. Rest of the results are available online at \cite{github.MPass} in the \texttt{docs} folder.

\caption{Verification Results for examples from \cite{MPSV11} and \cite{JRSVgit}}\label{tbl:experiments}
\end{table}

\Cref{tbl:experiments} shows that seven out of nine examples have been proved by \MPass\ to be safe in less than three seconds.
Also, \MPass\ found two safe examples to be faulty when we raised the phase bound from 3 to 4 for \Abp\ and from 4 to 6 for \Stp.
In both cases, the \texttt{unordered} channel semantic has been considered.
It seems that this particular channel semantic (\Ucs) exposes more false negatives than the stuttering and the lossy one (\Slcs\ and \Lcs).
%
Also, it seems that rising the phase bound makes the reachability analysis explore more behaviours of the system in general.
%
On the other hand, regarding the (faulty) examples listed in \Cref{tbl:experiments_f}, all of them have been proved to be unsafe in less than two seconds and within less than three phases.
%
Finally, we would like to mention that comparing \alternator\ with \MPass\ would be hazardous since a phase does not have the same semantic in both of the tools.
%
%Nevertheless, by comparing the detailed experimental results of \MPass\ and \texttt{alternator}  \cite{github.alternator,github.mpass},
%one can notice that the number assertions generated by \MPass\ for the same "semantic" phase bound
%is smaller than the one generated by \texttt{alternator}.
